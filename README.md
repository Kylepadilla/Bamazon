# Bamazon Application

## Overview

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned this unit. The app takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. Bamazon tracks product sales across our store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.


### Customer Portal

 The Bamazon app prompts users with two messages. One that ask the customer the ID of the product they would like to buy. The second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the Bamazon app should check if there is enough of the product to meet the customer's request. If not, the Bamazon will log the phrase 
>`oooops! It looks like we dont have enough inn stock to fill this order. Try reducing the number of items you are attempting to purchase.`

, and then prevent the order from going through.

However, if Bamazon _does_ have enough of the product, the app will fulfill the customer's order. the Bamazon SQL database will automatically update to reflect the remaining quantity.Once the update goes through,  the total cost of their purchase will be displayed.

### Manager Portal
* The Bamazon Manager Portal requires user authentication using environmental variables and the dotenv node module. additionally, Bamazon will allow authorized users to chose from the following menu:

    * View Products for Sale: 
    
    * View Low Inventory
    
    * Add to Inventory
    
    * Add New Product

  * If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, Bamazon will list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities. If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, Bamazon will list all items with an inventory count lower than five. If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, Bamazon will display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store. If a manager selects `Add New Product`, Bamazon will allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.

* Bamzaon managers will also have the ability to log out and return to the user authentication prompt.

###Supervisor Portal
* The Bamazon Supervisor Portal comes equiped with environamental variables and the 'dotenv' module to handle user authentication. Once a Bamzon supervisor is verified, they will be greeted with the menu prompt as shown below: 






* This menu will alow supervisors to view product sales by department and add new departments. The bamazon supervisor portal is still in development, so expect more features to come in the near future!

### Dependencies

* dotenv (7.0.0): Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

* inquirer (6.2.2): A collection of common interactive command line user interfaces. Version 4.x only supports Node 6 and over. For Node 4 support please use version 3.x.

* mysql(2.16.0): This is a node.js driver for mysql. It is written in JavaScript, does not require compiling, and is 100% MIT licensed.


### Database 

*Bamazon uses MySql, DBeaver, and Xampp to store the company's data. The text below was taken from Oracle MySQL homepage:

>MySQL is the worldâ€™s most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability, and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, used by high profile web properties including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and all five of the top five websites*. Additionally, it is an extremely popular choice as embedded database, distributed by thousands of ISVs and OEMs.

*Additionally, DBeaver was used to interact with the SQL database. DBeaver is an SQL client and a database administration tool. For relational databases it uses the JDBC API to interact with databases via a JDBC driver. For other databases it uses proprietary database drivers. It provides an editor that supports code completion and syntax highlighting. You can download DBeaver here: https://dbeaver.io/
